if there IS NOT a .magicTranslator/credentials file
    Ask the user for his credentials
    create the file

loop through all the .po files in the directory tree
    if the .po file doesn't have corresponding .po.mt file, ask the user for what language
    this file should be translated to, and create a .po.mt file for this file, that has stored
    the language mapping.

    if the .po file DOES have a language mapping file, iterate through all the strings in the
    file. For each string that lacks a translation, create a TranslationObject and set it's id, source_text, note and target_language.
    Push the TranslationObject to a Dictionary

Loop through the TranslationObject Dictionary
    KEY = "mt_" + Create a SHA512 hash of id + source_text + note + secret
    if TranslationObject is MARKED_AS_CHECKED or STALE
        skip it
    Check openkeyval.org if KEY exists
    if not
        mark it as UNSCHEDULED
    if there is
        get the value, decrypt it with secret, as project_id
        if that project_id is MARKED_AS_CHECKED, do nothing else
        check the status of that project_id
            if the project has been completed, and is a translate project
                send it in as a proofread project
            if the project has been completed, and it is a proofread project
                grab the strings translated in the project, and put them into they respective
                places in the dictionary. Mark the translationobject as STALE
            Find all TranslationObjects with that project_id and set them as MARKED_AS_CHECKED

Loop through the Dictionary again, find all STALE
    Save them back to PO files

Construct XML from a all the UNSCHEDULED translationObjects.
    Submit a project
    set openkeyval.org KEY to (encrypt the project_id with secret)
